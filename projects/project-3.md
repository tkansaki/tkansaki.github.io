For a STEM project, my goal was to introduce the school to a Robotics engineering afterschool activity because Roosevelt had participated in VEX robotics competitions in years before and had some of the required materials to do so, but hadn't done so in years due to lack of intrest and/or funding. My goal was to convince the alumni association to fund a robotics team and get the school back into robotics competions.
