In my freshman year at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, radGrad was first introduced to aid students in attaining their computer Science degree. However,
at the time, the website was not covered all that much and it seemed as if the program was relatively new. Over the next few semesters, I would not use nor 
even hear about the radGrad program until about three years later when I took ICS 314. 

In this class, Professor Philip Jhonson is adamant about letting students know about it and getting students to use the program. Although he did not make it 
mandatory for his class, he made it known that he believes this will help students in not only getting their degree, but also getting a high level job after 
graduating. 

This is the only class that provided detailed tutorials on the radGrad program and how it can help you by showing available classes as well as available 
opportunities that will help students gain experience in their field. Because my professor decided to offer extra credit for at least trying out radGrad, I 
decided to go through the tutorial and learn how it can help me. 

I discovered that radGrad is actually pretty good for seeing what classes are offered in the computer science field. Not only are the class descriptions 
offered on the radGrad website far more informative than the description found on the school registration website, but it also has student reviews of the 
class that allow students to make more informed decisions on their class choices.

What I found most appealing about the radGrad program was the fact that it had a lot of opportunities listed ranging from internships to school and community 
activities. This is particularly helpful for me because I wanted to take a summer internship for the past couple summers, but could not find one. 

This summer, I plan to use radGrad to find internship opportunities for myself and perhaps participate more in activities related to my degree. Knowing how 
helpful radGrad can be now, I plan on using it for the rest of my attendance at UH
