summary: A keystroke program designed to secure a computer

This project was a team collaboration for the 2018 STEM Conference cyber security competition. The purpose of the projects was to use a keystroke device called a "rubber ducky" and program it to automatically secure a computer by changing the setting and moving all potentially harmful files to a single file for the user to look at. 

One of the main challenges we faced was getting the keystroke script to work on every Windows 10 computer no matter the state their computer is in. To do this, we had to implement a lot of command code to ensure that the right settings were being changed because coding the ducky script with a lot of tab's and enter's could cause the wrong settings to be changed. 

Another challenge we faced was timing. The script had to wait in between commands long enough for the computer to process them. A command may take a second to complete, but the keystroke script doesn't wait, resulting in failed, skipped, or incomplete commands.

My team won the competition because of our use of the terminal as a way to solve most of these problems.
