When it comes to asking a question, it is important that you ask the question correctly or in a smart way not only to help anyone 
who may attempt to answer your question, but also to help yourself. The better you make your question, the more likely someone will 
be able to answer it and help you out with whatever it is you may be working on. Information is reciprocated, meaning that the amount 
and level of detail you put in your question will be the same amount you get in your answer. If you give a broad question without any 
detail, you will get a generic answer that you probably could have searched yourself or knew already. It is also important to attempt 
to research or figure out an answer for yourself before asking because questions do not get instantaneous answers. Posting a question 
and waiting for an answer is counterproductive when you could have done some research and got the answer yourself.

It is important to help your answerer out by giving them not only details on your problem, but also details of solutions you already 
tried and failed. This question was poorly contrived as it gives little detail on the projects and the link to the photo provided does 
not help me visualise what is desired at all. Worst of all, it does not specify what language or platform that is being used. I don't 
know if this is an HTML, Java, c++, or etc. project. Even if I wanted to answer this question, I don't know if I can with such a lack 
of information.

This question has not only sufficient detail of what is wanted, but also a readable example of the code and an explanation of the problem. 
Furthermore, there is a brief explanation of what solutions he already knows could work to steer the answerer towards the answer desired. 

This has opened my eyes to how you ask a question can affect the answer, Especially with the first one because if I were trying to answer 
the question, I wouldn't know how due to simply lack of information. The only way would be to ask the poster for more detail like what 
language is this project being written in, but that doesn't seem worth my time. Therefore, that question will likely remain unanswered. 
If I want an answer with a good amount of detail that fits my specific need, I must give the same amount of detail in my question.
