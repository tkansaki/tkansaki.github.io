 I am a student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and an attending to attain my Computer Science degree. Despite having 
 such an interest in computers, I am not one to spend too much time on social media or online games. In fact, I have no 
 social media whatsoever. This fact seems to stun people as many would expect a computer science major student to be
 glues to a computer or some kind of device. I, however, do not spend as much time on a computer as you would think, however,
 my passion for computer science is not fueld by the fact i use it, but by my desire to understand how it works.
 
 Knowing that computers are the future, it is only natural to desire a form of understanding with the machine. Computers 
 will soon be part of our everyday lives and will run the world of our future. In fact, computers are alredy part of our
 daily lives and run far more of the world than we'd care to admit. Most of us rely on some sort of computer from the 
 phones that each one of us carry to the simple calculator we need for a college level math test. Despite relying on 
 computing technology so often, I realize how little I truly understand how such devices work.
 
 This class is part of my journey to acheiving my goal of not only earning a degree, but also to expand my knowledge on 
 the evergrowing technology that is the computer. I hope this class will not only expand my knowledge, but also give me
 experience on applying such knowledge in real world applications.
